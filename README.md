# TTC Route Planner
In Development..

## What To Be Expected
There is no good web TTC route planner, and I'm aiming to eventually create a really good one. Since this is a side-project and I am attending university, expect at least 3-4 months for some solid progression

### Update 1 (August 29, 2019)
Loads cards with currently only showing all the bus names using custom infinite scrolling in ReactJS with a simple loader
